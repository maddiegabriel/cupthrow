###  Limitations
1. No bonus Items Page (ran out of time!)
2. The Play Game page refreshes when you click the buttons - please just scroll back down to where you were on the page!
4. The player's cup is always loaded with EVERYTHING in the bag, not a selection based on the form (did this for simplicity) 

### How to Play my Game
1. Go to http://cis3260.socs.uoguelph.ca:30125
2. Create a new account under the "Sign Up" section. Enter a unique username, email and password and click "Create Account".
3. From the User Page, click the green "Start a New Game" button.
4. Read the displayed Goal section (describes what you're trying to throw) and Bag section (describes what you have in your Bag).
5. Fill in the "Load" form with a description of what kinds of items you want to load from your Bag into your Cup. Click "Load" to load your cup.
6. In the "Throw" section, complete your 3 throws by clicking the "Throw" buttons in order. You must click all 3 buttons to progress. Your throw score & results will appear under each Throw button.
7. Once you finish your third throw, the game is over! The scores are displayed in the "Scores" section, and the winner is declared.
8. Click "Start a New Game" to play again!
